"1. COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to delay. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly."
"2. Data on age, sex, race and ethnicity, admission date, in-hospital death and SARS-CoV-2-testing were collected for all cases."
"3. White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native all represent non-Hispanic ethnicity groups; Other includes persons in multiple race categories and persons for whom race is unknown."
"4. Data on demographics (age, sex, race and ethnicity) include all available data to date. Due to delays in reporting, data on intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and discharge diagnoses are restricted to sampled and completed cases reported during March 1May 31, 2020. Data on underlying medical conditions and signs/symptoms at admission are restricted to sampled cases reported during March 1May 31, 2020 with non-missing data. Data on in-hospital deaths are restricted to all completed cases reported during March 1May 31, 2020. Due to the sampling methodology for adults aged >= 18 years, counts are not shown, and weighted percentages are presented for intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, underlying medical conditions, signs/symptoms at admission, and discharge diagnoses."
